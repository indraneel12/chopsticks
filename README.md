## Service

This repository primarily contains the output of `flutter build web` and
not the original source code that I have written in
Dart (alongside Flutter) and Python, as it is intended only for deployment
(at least until I complete my course) in order to avoid instances/illusions of
plagiarism and hindrance to my degree certificate.

- **Analysis**

  <https://indraneel12.github.io/chopsticks/indrubot-analysis/>

The core goal (apropos porting this relatively unpopular game to a
digital platform) has been accomplished, wherein marketing, business, and
suchlike have not been a priority, as I view this project more
along the lines of a stepping stone towards enhancing my
software engineering calibre.
